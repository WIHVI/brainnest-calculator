# Calculator

A vanilla JavaScript application I have built for a Frontend Development Industry Training Course, really enjoyed the process of creating this application.

It was a challenging project where I had to implement all the necessary JavaScript logic to make the calculator work well.

I learned more on how DOM works, how to add keyboard support and more about how JavaScript works in general.
